work in progress
The Spring Framework was first developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. It was developed to make the development of Java applications quicker, easier and safer for developers. Spring Framework is an open-source, lightweight, easy-to-build framework that can also be considered as a framework of frameworks as it houses various frameworks like Dependency Injection, Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, Spring Hibernate, Spring AOP, EJB, JSF, etc. A key element of Spring is the feature of the application’s infrastructural support. Spring focuses on providing the “plumbing” of enterprise-level applications and ensures that the developers can focus purely on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments. Applications developed in Spring are more reliable, scalable, and very simple to build and maintain. Spring was developed as means to help developers manage the business objects of the application. Due to its vast features and flexibilities, Spring became the most loved framework for developing enterprise-level Java-based applications. In the following section, we will see what are the most commonly asked interview questions and answers to prepare you for Spring-based interviews.
